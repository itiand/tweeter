# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

A simple-page AJAX-based Twitter clone, using jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3 - front end (client-side) project.

## My Contribution

I took the lead in developing the user interface and integrated the design with the provided backend template. While aligning with the existing backend structure, I introduced several tweaks to reflect my own UI/UX vision.

## Features

- SPA utilizing AJAX requests to prevent page refreshes
- Subtle responsive animations
- Sage against simple XSS injection
- Fluid scroll to top transition and dropdown tweet input for ease of use
